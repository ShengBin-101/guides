# Beginner's Guide to ROS

## Welcome

Hello there! Learning ROS for the first time may seem daunting for most, so I hope this space can serve as a guide to make the learning process more directed and newbie-friendly!

From personal experience, I struggled when learning ROS for the first time due to my lack of experience in both programming and robotics in general.

But I assure you, that with a positive attitude to learn and a lot of patience, you will find learning ROS manageable!

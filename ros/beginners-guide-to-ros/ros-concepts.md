# ROS Concepts

To learn:

* Nodes & Topics
* Publishers & Subscribers
* Services & Actions
* Launch Files & Parameters
* ROS File Structure & How to Write Packages

***

**Although on ROS1, the first 5 videos (\~1hr each) of this playlist is great to learn ROS Concepts. These concepts are very much the same in ROS2.**

If you have followed my setup for ROS2 Humble, I recommend going through the Official ROS2 Humble Tutorials to have a hands-on for ROS2. Other distributions also have their own set of tutorials!
